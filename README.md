my first app will be a Bible enhanced for memorizing verses.

I have been teaching myself swift and iOS development.
I am starting a Bible App designed for memorizing verses and making quick searches.  The App will also contain features that will aid readers to make, save and retreive notes promptly. Other essential features are also being considered. This is my first shot at ios development.
Need encouragement from the profs.

I'd do my best to keep up with the pace
